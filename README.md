# i3wm scripts and dotfiles

- Conky configuration
- Search script: to search from i3bar
- Rename workspace on the fly

I adapted the rename workspace scripts from [here](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/i3-wm-scripts/blob/master/i3-rename-workspace) and [here](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/451/dynamically-change-workspace-name-with-ease/).
I could not find a way to change the keybindings using i3-msg, so I took this naive yet simple approach. If someone reading this knows a better way, please let me know. :)
